We define type-two classes $\classLtwo$, $\classNCtwo$, $\classFLtwo$,
and $\classFNCtwo$.
We also define $\classPtwo$-completeness 
under suitable reductions using these small classes.


We demonstrate that these new classes are useful to study the complexity 
of problems in analysis.
We show that roots of polynomials are $\classNCtwo$ computable,
by putting together results from discrete complexity theory and
 complex analysis.
We show that the inverse operation and the fix-point operation on contraction mapping are $\classP$-complete, which implies that these operators are inherently sequential.
Many operators are not studied enough after it is shown to be polynomial-time
computable.
One can investigate the precise complexity of these operators.


We show that solving the initial value problem is $\classFPSPACEtwo$-complete
if $g$ is once differentiable.
We also show that the solution of the initial value problem can be $\classCH$-hard 
even if $g$ is polynomial-time computable and $k$-times differentiable.
Tightening the gap between $\classPSPACE$-computability and $\classCH$-hardness 
or formulating a suitable type-two class $\classtwofont C$ 
(probably analogous to $\classCH$) and stating that $k$-times differentiable 
initial value problem is $\classtwofont C$-hard are left for future work.
